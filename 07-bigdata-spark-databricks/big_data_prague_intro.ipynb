    "Databricks is a platform for running Spark without complex cluster management or tedious maintenance tasks. Spark is a distributed computation framework for executing code in parallel across many different machines. Databricks is the Spark team's enterprise solution makes big data simple by providing Spark as a hosted solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Databricks Terminology\n",
    "\n",
    "-   ****Workspaces**** : Where you store the ****notebooks**** and ****libraries****.\n",
    "-   ****Notebooks**** : Like Jupyter Notebooks that can run `Scala`, `Python`, `R`, `SQL`, or `Markdown`. Define language by `%[language name]` at the top of the cell. Connect to a cluster to run.\n",
    "-   ****Dashboards**** can be created from ****notebooks**** as a way of displaying the output of cells without the code.\n",
    "-   ****Libraries**** : Packages / Modules. You can install them via pypi.\n",
    "-   ****Tables**** : Structured data, that can be stored in data lake / cloud storage. Stored on Cluster or cached in memory.\n",
    "-   ****Clusters**** : Groups of computers that you treat as a single computer to perform operations on big sets of data.\n",
    "-   ****Jobs**** : Schedule execution on ****notebooks**** or Python scripts. They can be created either manually or via the REST API.\n",
    "-   ****Apps**** : 3rd party integrations with the Databricks platform like Tableau."

    "### Spark's history\n",
    "\n",
    "Spark was developed by founders of Databricks in AMPLab at UC Berkeley. Started 2009, donated to Apache open source in 2013.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Contexts/Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "Before Spark 2.X many used the `sparkContext` made available as `sc` and the `SQLContext` made available as `sqlContext`. The `sqlContext` makes a lot of DataFrame functionality available while the `sparkContext` focuses more on the Apache Spark engine itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Spark 2.X, there is just one context - the `SparkSession`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Data Interfaces\n",
    "\n",
    "Key interfaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   ****The DataFrame**** : Collection of distributed `Row` types (note no indicies for look up). Similar to pandas or R dataframe.\n",
    "-   ****The RDD (Resilient Distributed Dataset)**** : Interface to a sequence of data objects that consist of one or more types that are located across a variety of machines in a cluster. Focus on DataFrames as those will be supersets of the current RDD functionality.\n",

We've told Apache Spark to cache that data after we compute it for the first time. So let's call a full scan of the data with a count twice.
